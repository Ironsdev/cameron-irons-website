                    The Popsicle stick chair was a design born out of care and convenience. I wanted to create a chair
                    that my son would enjoy. When I switched from paper to wooden models, my fiancé had popsicle sticks
                    for her beauty supplies. Instead of going to the store, she was kind enough to let me use them. Once
                    I built the basic shape out of the popsicle sticks, it clicked. The scalloped edges were playful and
                    different. I went through many iterations of the design, ultimately opting for a full slip-form
                    construction so that it could be broken down and reassembled. The upholstery features a simple
                    complementary color scheme of blue and yellow Maharam fabric, 1/4-inch foam, staples, and a clean
                    Hidem technique to finish the edges. I originally intended to use the lighting studio at the
                    University of Iowa; however, the snow had other plans. Instead, I used Adobe Firefly to remove my
                    models and the chair from the background, placing them into studio and editorial settings. The end
                    result is very true to how they look in person.
