                    The color study book was an excellent introduction to the semester. While simple in scope, the
                    project allowed for a wide range of creative exploration. Although color theory is a foundational
                    part of every artist’s education, this assignment challenged me to think more critically about the
                    role of color within interior spaces. The project combined research, design development, and a final
                    printed book. Some color palettes were difficult to resolve, requiring extensive research, but the
                    process was ultimately very rewarding. Translating digital studies into a physical object was
                    especially satisfying. Overall, I was very pleased with the final book and the range and vibrancy of
                    the color explorations it presents.
