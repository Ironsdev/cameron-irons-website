                    For this project, students were asked to select and recreate a famous chair to later incorporate
                    into a spatial design. I chose Arne Jacobsen’s Egg Chair, as I immediately recognized it from its
                    appearances in iconic films. I associated the chair with a dramatic, supervillain-inspired aesthetic
                    and used that influence to inform the overall design of the space. The models and renders were
                    completed in 3ds Max. Although this is older work, it remains a project I enjoyed and one that
                    reflects my early interest in furniture and spatial storytelling.
