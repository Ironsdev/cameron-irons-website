                    The Ouroboros wallpaper is one of my favorite projects from the University of Iowa. While
                    brainstorming, I noticed a trend in wavy murals, textiles, and patterns, and wanted to push that
                    idea into something more dynamic. Although I explored other concepts in my digital sketches, I
                    couldn’t let go of the Ouroboros, despite knowing how challenging it would be to execute.
                    With extra time allotted, I carefully worked out how to tessellate the design both vertically and
                    horizontally. I developed a color-coded system to track lines and guide movement, created custom
                    Photoshop brushes, and found an efficient balance between working in Photoshop and Illustrator.
                    After completing the final drawing, I built a simple masking system that allowed for instant color
                    changes. The victory lap came when my fiancé and I experimented with color combinations and chose
                    our favorites. This was also my first project in years using my Huion drawing tablet, and it
                    reignited my love for digital drawing.
