                    This clocktower concept was developed as my submission for a commission at Finkbine Golf Course in
                    Iowa City in 2021. At the outset of the project, I was unfamiliar with the relationship between post
                    clocks and golf courses. Through research, I discovered that clock towers serve as symbols of
                    prestige at golf courses around the world. I chose a traditional design language consistent with
                    other well-known post clocks, incorporating imagery inspired by Iowa’s state flower around the clock
                    face and introducing subtle curves in the post to echo these organic forms.
                    As this was a conceptual proposal, I envisioned additional ornamental detailing in line with
                    traditional post clock designs for a final iteration, along with refinements to the color palette to
                    better align with the University of Iowa’s Hawkeye color scheme. During my research, I identified
                    Verdin, a clock manufacturer based in Cincinnati, Ohio, and pursued the possibility of realizing the
                    project. I was in direct contact with their general manager to discuss production, transportation,
                    and installation logistics. Although the project ultimately did not move forward, I remain eager to
                    revisit and further develop this concept should the opportunity arise.
