                    For this office workspace design, I chose a law firm for my client profile. I researched the typical
                    workflow of law firms to gain a proper understanding of how to lay out the space. After reviewing
                    the different types of legal practices, I chose family law because it allowed for a more playful
                    approach. I wanted the design to feel serious, thoughtful, and relaxing, while still being mindful
                    of young clients who may be present. Working in CET can be challenging, but once you get into a
                    groove, it is actually quite enjoyable. In the final architectural print, I included a color-coded
                    and numbered layout to improve readability. I also chose to place a 2D top view next to the render
                    to further contextualize the spaces.
